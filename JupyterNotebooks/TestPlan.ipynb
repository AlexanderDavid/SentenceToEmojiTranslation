    "# Test Plan\n",
    "For every algorithm developed it is important to design some test cases that the algorithm should pass. For an algorithm that generates summaries that can be slightly difficult. For systems that take input from one known language to another there are established techniques that are avalable but for our project we need to come up with something different. The solution we came up with for his is to generate test cases \"on the fly\" and prompt a user to reverse the given summary for comparison. We do this by generating (or reading in) some sentences, summarizing these sentences, and then comparing the human guess as to what the emojis mean to the input sentence. The general flow for this process is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Generate (or read) sentences\n",
    "   2. Summarize each of the sentences\n",
    "   3. Take the top 20 sentences, sorted by the certainty score\n",
    "   4. For each machine translated sentence:\n",
    "       1. Provide the user with the emojis\n",
    "       2. Provide the user with an approximate sentence length\n",
    "       3. Prompt the user to tranlate the emojis into a sentence\n",
    "   5. For each machine translated sentence-user translated sentence pair:\n",
    "       1. Calculate the distance between the two sentences using sent2vec (might need another metric)\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have the list of numerical scores for the translations we can do some analysis on how the algorithm actually performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues\n",
    "1. Nothing to compare the cosine similarity against. Need to do some testing to determine what a \"good\" number is.\n",
    "2. The dataset we have has too many complex sentences. We should begin testing with simpler inputs"
