    "# Naive Sentence to Emoji Translation \n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "To workshop a naive version of an sentence to emoji translation algorithm. The general idea is that sentences can be \"chuncked\" out into n-grams that are more related to a single emoji. The related-ness of an n-gram to an emoji is directly related to the cosine similarity of the sent2vec representation of the sentence and the sent2vec representation of one of the emoji's definitions. The emoji definitons are gathered from the [emoji2vec](https://github.com/uclmr/emoji2vec) github repo and the sent2vec model is from the [sent2vec](https://github.com/epfml/sent2vec) github repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Issues\n",
    "- The generation of the summary is so incredibly slow\n",
    "- There are some issues with lemmatization (e.g. poop != pooped when lemmatized)\n",
    "- /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/scipy/spatial/distance.py:720: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in float_scalars\n",
    "  dist = 1.0 - uv / np.sqrt(uu * vv)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ideas\n",
    "- Add bias for fewer emojis. Some of the generated sentences are just the sentence translated into 1-grams and  it is really easy to find an emoji that represents a one word. If some how the sentence was scored both based on sum similarity and the length of the sentence that might produce better summarizations\n",
    "- Use a larger sent2vec model"

    "## Sentence Cleaning\n",
    "The general idea with sentence cleaning is that the sentences need to be put into the same \"format\" for better analysis. There are two main aspects of cleaning: 1) removal, and 2) modification. Removal is primarily for tokens that do not contribute to the sentence at all. These include \".\", \"and\", \"but\". Normally this is a standard step in sentence cleaning but it has actually has zero effect on the output that I can see. However, token modification changes the spelling of tokens to uniform all tokens that use the same root. For example \"rocked\", \"rock\", \"rocking\" should all be reduced to their lemma of \"rock\". There are two different ways to do this: [stemming and lemmatization](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html). "
